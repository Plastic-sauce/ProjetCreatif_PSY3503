# 1. Les prémisses

> [!timeline|t-l] **Alcmeon** _Subtitle_
>- the seat of thought/sensation = the brain 

> [!timeline|t-r] **Socrate/Platon** *Subtitle*
> - knowledge =  eternal + innate, 
> - soul = independent from body,
> - transmitted by reincarnation 

> [!timeline|t-l] **Aristote** *Subtitle*
> - Empiriste
>- mind = blank slate,
>- sensory = beginning of knowledge,
>- structures = present from birth but requires experiences 

> [!timeline|t-r] **René D'écartés** *Subtitle*
>- -> Body + mind are separate but interact
>- Nativite +Dualiste 
>- Gave birth to associationnisme 

> [!timeline|t-l] **John Locke** *Empiriste*
>- The soul is formed through sensations + perceptions
>- Primary quality = object as it exists 
>- Secondary Quality = specifically attributed by the perceiver. 

> [!timeline|t-r] **David Hume** *Empiriste, Scepticisme, Naturalisme Métaphysique*
>- All ideas stem from experience 
>- Soul =  sensations + perceptions + emotions 

> [!timeline|t-l] **Emmanuel Kant** *Subtitle*
>- Concepts are linked by intuition rather than by randomness, which allows us to structure our experiences 
>- ->nativiste/empiriste 

> [!timeline|t-r] **Wilhelm Wundt** *Subtitle*
>- Structuralisme 
>- Opens the first experimental psychology labroratory
>- Insists on the structure of the spirit

# 2. Les précurseurs

> [!timeline|t-l] **Hermann Ebbinghaus** _Subtitle_
>- _Theory_: 
>	- adapts measurements from Fechner, Wundt to process such as memory 
>- _Experiments_: 
>	- Memorization of series of num, words, syllables 
>- _Results_: 
>	- a learning curved is revealed, an increase in the num of repetitions is required to retain longer lists. 
>	- Réactualisation -> impact of prior learning on re-learning 
>	- Learning = more effective when distributed vs messaged
>- _Impact_: 
>	- Changes the word from ~~connaissance~~ -> apprentissage
>	- Application in education

> [!timeline|t-r] **Edward Lee Thorndike** *Subtitle*
> - _Theory_: 
>	- Pulls inspiration from William James + Charles Darwin 
>	- Studies the inteligence of animals through learning 
>	- Seeks to highlight the laws of learning 
>- _Experiments_:
>	- Les Boites a problèmes: 
>		- Simple mechanism from which a hungry cat has to get out to find food 
>		- Learning by trail and error
>- _Results_:
>	- Gives general interpretation of learning based on two pillars: 
>		- ==Loi de L’exercice:==
>			- Time is saved by trying to solve the problem 
>			- Learning = progressive 
>		- ==Loi de l’effet:==
>			- Impact of satisfaction
>			- Behaviour that produces satisfying outcome = more likely to be repeated. 

> [!timeline|t-l] **Ivan Petrovich Pavlov** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- Physiologist specializing in the stomach. 
>	- Awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1904 for his work. 
>	- His foray into psychology was accidental!
>- _Experiments_:
>	- Measurement of a dog's salivary secretions and realization that the dog is salivating when the laboratory technician arrives. A neutral stimulus given before the stimulus that usually arouses the animal can, after several repetitions, trigger arousal on its own.
>- _Results_:
>	- Conditioned reflex or classical conditioning. A sufficient number of repetitions of the temporal sequence SN and SI enables progressive learning. Extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, discrimination.
>- _Impact_:
>	- Placebo effect. Not the acquisition of a new behavior, but rather a new association (reflex trigger).

> [!timeline|t-r] **John Broadus Watson** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- Founder of Behaviourism (1913)
>	- Does not want to concern himself with states of consciousness (inner life) because they are not observable = black box. 
>	- The behavior of living organisms and their relationship with the environment must be studied scientifically. 
>	- Separates chair of philosophy and psychology
>- _Experiments_:
>	- Analysis of stimuli and responses (measurable)
>	- Learning in the animal world offers a privileged field of research, insofar as it lends itself to experimentation.
>- _Results_:
>	- Loi de la fréquence:
>		- Déclanchement de la phobie du petit Albert
>	- Loi de récence: 
>- _Impact_:
>	- Modeling, external conditions are likely to shape the individual. 
>	- Forms a new scientific psychology based solely on observables, on measurable data. 
>	- Above all, don't open the black box.	

> [!timeline|t-l] **Max Wertheimer** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- a team of three researchers Max Wertheimer, kurt Koffka and Wolfgang kölher.
>	- Gestalt theory:
>		- the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
>		- Fundamentally opposed to Associationism. 
>		- Want to show the validity of forms or totality as a basic explanation in psychology.
>- _Experiments_:
>	- Phi effect, ambiguous shape/form figures, experiments with monkeys (kölher).
>- _Results_:
>	- phi effect - perception of movement where there is only a succession of images. Configuration, sudden understanding (insight) or reorganization of the spatial field to find a solution.
>- _Impact_:
>	- In education, focus on comprehension. 
>	- Learning to read using the global (or semi-global) method. 
>	- Introduction of the notion of structure in psychology, with interpretations based on a global organization of configurations.

> [!timeline|t-r] **Burrhus Frederic Skinner** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- Neo behaviouralism 
>	- Instilled a new form of conditioning 
>- _Experiments_:
>	- Boîte de Skinner:
>		- Animals are tasked with pressing on a pedal to receive a reward. 
>- _Results_:
>	- Loi empirique de l‘effet:
>		- conditionnement opérant: consequence of a behaviour increases the probability of a behaviour occurring. 
>- _Impact_:
>	- In parenting
>	- Reinforcement to maintain desired behaviour 
>	- He claims that men is susceptible to shaping and modeling 

> [!timeline|t-l] **Edward Chace Tolmann** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- Roots of cognitivisme 
>	- Learning = acquisition of information about sequences of events
>- _Experiments_: 
>	- counter-experiments that challenged the positions of radical behaviorism
>- _Results_: 
>	- latent learning, cognitive map
>- _Impact_: 
>	- these results shook behaviorism and are still relevant today. However, they were put on the back burner for a long time.

> [!timeline|t-r] **Jean Piaget** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- He linked biology to philosophy through child psychology. The child is first a biological being, then a thinking being.
>- _Experiments_:
>	- conservation of substances
>- _Results_:
>	- evidence of how the child functions.
>	- Stade sensori moteur = coordination of actions to build a practical universe
>	- Stade pré opératoire = transition from actions to representations
>	- Stade des opérations concrètes = linking transformations together.
>	- Stade des opérations formelles = freeing oneself from reality to glimpse the universe of possibilities.
>- _Impact_:
>	- notion as assimilation accommodation

> [!timeline|t-l] **Lev Semionovitch Vygotski** *Subtitle*
>- _Theory_: 
>	- his ideas were imbued with the dialectical thinking of Karl Marx and the promise of social transformation. 
>	- Wants to highlight the contributions of the social to child development. 
>	- Wants to establish a general theory of the construction of intelligence.
>- _Experiments_:
>	- studies the establishment of concepts in children. 
>	- Classification of objects according to figures. 
>	- Complex chains to link objects by successive and variable criteria.
>- _Results_:
>	-  social variables are part of the learning process. Guidance.
>- _Impact_:
>	- the adult's role is to help the child gradually move beyond his or her competencies. Appropriation of the environment's cultural data.
